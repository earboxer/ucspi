.Nd UCSPI SOCKS 5 proxy client
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tcpclient
.Ar proxy-host
.Ar proxy-port Nm sockc
.Ar host
.Ar port
.Ar program
.Op arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a SOCKS 5 proxy handler for a UCSPI execchain.
It communicates with tcpclient over pipes with filedescriptor 6 and 7.
tcpclient connects to the SOCKS proxy and delegates the further protocol
handling to
.Nm sockc .
sockc talks with the SOCKS proxy and initiates a tcp connection to
.Ar host
with
.Ar port .
After connection initiation
.Nm
executes
.Ar program
with
.Ar arguments .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables are defined in the UCPSI specification.
By the usage of
.Nm sockc
there are two TCP connections.
One from the
.Nm tcpclient
to the SOCKS proxy and an other from the SOCKS proxy to the server.
The
.Nm sockc
programm tries to handel this in a transparant way for the program.
All variables which are set from tcpclient to describe the TCP connection
between program and proxy are overwritten with the description of the TCP
connection between proxy and server.
Additionally variables are set to describe the connection between program
and proxy.
